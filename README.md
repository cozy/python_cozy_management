## Description

Helper to manage self hosting cozy

** âš  This tool has only been tested on the platforms we support (Debian / Ubuntu / Raspbian). Some of the commands will not work on other distributions. It is mostly a wrapper around shell commands, so if you use another distribution, you can probably read the code and adapt the commands to your distribution **
